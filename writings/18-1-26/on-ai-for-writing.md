## the proliferation of ai in the written word

To preface this, I cannot in good conscience say that I am not guilty of the usage of ai in writing. In my defence, my usage of LLMs in writing were all in topics I did not care for.
To further preface this, I am also not saying that I have anything particularly novel to say or that I am a particularly good writer.
However, seeing the vast amount of people resorting to LLMS to produce the outputs of their very souls and minds is particularly disheartening.
This is beyond just the production of 'slop' content on social media, but in the everyday communication between people. 
There is a particular [monologue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xd_7ybA16SU) in the anime 'Orb: on the movements of the earth' that comes to mind.
"Using letters, a person can cross space and time. I might shed tears reading the news of 200 years ago, or laugh at rumours from 1,000 years ago."
