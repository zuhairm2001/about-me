## the proliferation of ai in the written word

To preface this, I cannot in good conscience say that I am not guilty of the usage of ai in writing. In my defence, my usage of LLMs in writing were all in topics I did not care for.
To further preface this, I am also not saying that I have anything particularly novel to say or that I am an inherently good writer.
In fact, I have always been quite a poor writer, and one that did not put much value to writing beyond the act of putting words on a paper to achieve some arbritrary goal.
In seeing the vast amount of people resorting to LLMS to produce the outputs of their very souls and minds is also perhaps a symptom of that.
It's disheartening to say the least, when I see coworkers have tabs open to help chatgpt produce a happy birthday message for another coworker, or to write an email that could have been 
done with a less than minor excertion of their mind. These are just a minute sample of what is going on around all of us.
This is beyond just the production of 'slop' content on social media, which is another topic of it's own, but in the everyday communication between people. 

One would hope that in the automation of labourious tasks, we would be able to free up more time to do things that are more meaningful to us.
Instead, it seems that the advent of AI achieved the opposite en-masse. Of course there are cases where this is not true, but the general consensus is not that.

There is a particular [monologue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xd_7ybA16SU) in the anime 'Orb: on the movements of the earth' that comes to mind.
"Using letters, a person can cross space and time. I might shed tears reading the news of 200 years ago, or laugh at rumours from 1,000 years ago."

In this day and age, I value a poorly written email much more than an obviously generated artifact from an LLM which contains no soul nor personality. I don't believe the doomers that 
go on about the ai revolution causing the mass unemployment of all knowledge workers, but at this rate it may be more so that most people were perhaps never meant to be knowledge workers in the first place.
Instead, perhaps the social structure of the world has formed in such a way that the only way to make a meaningful living is to be a knowledge worker. Maybe these people will finally be freed to be able 
to do what they want, that is not bound by the constraints of their monitor or their office environment. 

Being born in the 2000s has definitely led to an eventful couple of decades, and i doubt that the next 20 years will be any less eventful, for the worse or for the better. But i cannot bring myself to say
that I am not blessed for living in this time. Marvel and wonder exist all around us at this time, just beyond the noise of the world. May we all find it and see that we are truly living in one of the most
transformative times in human history.
